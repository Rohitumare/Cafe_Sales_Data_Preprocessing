# Cafe_Sales_Data_Preprocessing

A beginner-friendly data analytics project focused on cleaning and transforming cafe sales data.


## Project Overview  
This repository demonstrates the data preprocessing steps applied to raw cafe sales data. The goal is to showcase systematic techniques for cleaning, validating, and transforming datasets to make them suitable for further analysis or modeling.


## Repository Contents  
- `Cafe_Sales_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook guiding you through the full cleaning and feature engineering pipeline.  
- `cafe_sales.csv` — Original unprocessed dataset containing cafe transaction records.  
- `cleaned_cafe_sales_data.csv` — Output dataset after applying preprocessing steps.  


## Dataset  
The dataset includes transactional fields such as:
- Date/time of sale  
- Product or item sold  
- Quantity, price, and total amount  
- Payment type and customer identifiers 
- Additional metadata (e.g. location, Transaction ID)

This data is processed to improve data quality and enrich features for downstream tasks.


## Preprocessing Workflow  

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Load and inspect the dataset for basic structure and statistics.  
- Visualize missing data patterns, outliers, and distributions.  
- Identify anomalies or data quality issues.

### 2. Data Cleaning  
- Handle missing values via imputation or removal.  
- Detect and clean anomalies (e.g., zero or negative sales totals, impossible quantities).  
- Convert data types appropriately (e.g., parse dates, convert numeric fields).

### 3. Output Files  
- Export the cleaned dataset as `cleaned_cafe_sales_data.csv`.  


## Insights & Next Steps

### Key insights: 
After cleaning, you might observe sales trends by hour or weekday, transactions out of expected ranges, or seasonal patterns.

### Next steps: You can extend this work by:
- Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the cleaned data.
- Creating interactive dashboards (e.g., using Streamlit) to visualize trends and anomalies.


## Technologies Used
